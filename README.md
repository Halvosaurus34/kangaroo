# Kangaroo (deCode Hackathon 2021)

Kangaroo is a communication app for modern companies. In Kangaroo you can spontaneously meet co-workers at your company. You can join the casual non-topic rooms like a coffee break and coworking space if you don't have anything in mind. You don't need to schedule anything. Don't make plans, just join a room!

## Our Process

I worked with the Mitel team in the 2021 deCode Hackathon. This was my first experience working as a team in web development. Our team split up into front end, back end, and design. I worked as a front end dev. I want to thank my great mentors at Mitel.
